# Welcome: Testable_Build Branch
This Branch is for the testable but not deployable build of our game. As of now there are no instructions in games so the controls are as follows.

- **Movement Controls:** WASD
- **Rotation Control:** Follows mouse movement
- **Abilities:** 1 2 3 4
- **In-game menu**: ESC
- **Stat window:** K (during dungeon crawl phase)

**Goal:** Collect as many artifacts as you can. 

**Start up:** Create the dungeon, your IP address will be displayed on screen. Use that IP address to join the game from another instance of the game. Connection is through LAN. You can also run two instances of the game on one computer.

Have fun and enjoy!
